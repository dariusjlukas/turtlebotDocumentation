            This is a collection of information about setting up, using, and troubleshooting the turtlebot3. 
            Most of the information on this site can be found elsewhere online (I try to attribute sources), but
            this is supposed to be a convenient repository of information in a single place. If you find any
            errors in this document, please contact me (contact info at bottom of page) or post an issue on the 
            github. Formatting wise, you should know that:
            <div class="cmd">$ This is a command you can type into a terminal. <div style="color:green"> Note: If it does NOT have the <q>$</q>
            at the beginning of the line, it is terminal output and you should NOT try to type it into your terminal.</div>
            </div>
            and anytime you see <q>{ }</q> in a terminal it means you need to enter some specific information, and
            do not type the <q>{</q> or <q>}</q>. Also, anything with a dotted underline like <span class="tooltip">this
                <span class="tooltiptext">This is a tooltip</span></span> is a tooltip, and you can hover over the text to get more info. 
                Tooltips in the command line font have green dotted underlines.

                <h4 style="color: #f44336">Warnings:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do NOT power the turtlebots via the usb port on the raspberry pi, I have killed a pi doing this</li>
                    <li>Do NOT leave the batteries plugged into the turtlebots or they will be discharged down to 0v. If this happens, I do not recommend charging them again (the chargers wonâ€™t let you anyway)</li>
                
                </ul>

            <h4 style="color: #f44336">Important Note:</h4>
                I am assuming you are using a computer running linux; I did everything on Ubuntu 16.04. Much of 
                this can be done on a Virtual machine, but some of the Mynt Eye camera things may be difficult 
                if you go that route. I recommend either installing Ubuntu locally or using one of the workstations 
                in the lab. If you are attempting this with Windows I wish you luck, you're going to need it.
