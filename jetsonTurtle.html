            <h4>Overview</h4>
            The Jetson Nano can be used in conjunction with or instead of a Raspberry Pi 3 on the Turtlebot 3's. 
            The main limitation of using the Jetson Nano is that it's only compatible with ROS Melodic, whereas the 
            Raspberry Pi's use ROS Kinetic. At the time of writing this, almost all packages used by the turtlebot 
            have been ported to ROS Melodic except for GMapping and possibly a few others. This is not necessarily 
            a problem if you are running most of the turtlebot packages on a separate computer, since you can use 
            an external computer running Kinetic to interface with the turtlebot running Melodic. It should also be 
            noted that the Jetson Nano does not come with WiFi capabilities, so you will need to get a <span class="tooltip">NIC<span class="tooltiptext">Network Interface Card</span></span> if you 
            will be using the Jetson Nano as the sole <span class="tooltip">SBC<span class="tooltiptext">Single Board Computer</span></span>. 
            A compatible NIC can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Intel-Dual-Band-Wireless-Ac-8265/dp/B01MZA1AB2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=intel+8265ngw&qid=1554739126&s=gateway&sr=8-1&linkCode=sl1&tag=jetsonhacks-20&linkId=ddc9ed0c07468175a00a20f14118fac5&language=en_US">here</a>, 
            and a complete set of parts lists can be found under the Resources tab. <br> <br>

            Alternatively, you can get the most compatibility by running both the Jetson Nano and a Raspberry Pi 
            on the Turtlebot. The problems with doing that are physical space on the turtlebot, powering the 
            Jetson Nano, and adding the Jetson Nano to the ROS network. Physical space can be solved by adding more 
            plates to the turtlebot (if you run out of plates, they can be 3D printed relatively well). Powering 
            can be difficult because the OpenCR normally provides 5v to the Raspberry Pi, which can be used directly 
            if the Jetson Nano is used instead. It should be noted that you must put a jumper on J48 to switch to powering 
            from the barrel jack instead of from the USB port. If you want to use both the Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi then the 
            Jetson Nano will need a different power supply (because the one on the OpenCR is limited to 4A max). 
            The OpenCR does have a power pass-through from the battery, which will need to be regulated to 5v. A 
            buck converted can be used to do this, and a suitable one can be found <a href="#">here</a>. Ideally, 
            the Jetson Nano would be powered from both of its 5v pins on the GPIO header (3A max each) and you would 
            not need to worry about not having enough power for peripherals. That being said, you can get away with 
            powering the Jetson through the barrel jack connector at a maximum of 4A or even through only one 5v header 
            pin, although I would highly recommend using both header pins because the Jetson will still pull over 4A 
            through the 3A rated pin, which could cause damage over time.

            <h4>Jetson+Raspberry Pi Architecture</h4>
            Turtlebot #4 is configured with both a Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi, so there are a few important architecture 
            differences compared to a Turtlebot with only one <span class="tooltip">SBC<span class="tooltiptext">Single Board Computer</span></span>, 
            namely the connection between the Pi and Jetson Nano, the Jetson Nano power delivery, and the distribution of control.
            The Jetson and Pi are both on the same Wifi network so it is possible for them to communicate that way. The problem is 
            that there is limited bandwidth and high latency, around 100 ms based on pings. So, as an alternative to communicating 
            over Wifi there is also an <span class="tooltip">ethernet<span class="tooltiptext">A spliced category or "cat" 5e 
                cable to be precise</span></span> cable running between the Jetson and Pi which provides a gigabit, sub 1 ms 
            latency connection between them. One way to have the traffic between the Jetson and Pi go through the ethernet 
            cable and all other traffic go over Wifi is to run the master node on the Pi, and then on the Jetson set the 
            master node as the Pi's IP address over the ethernet cable. All other devices can then use the Pi's Wifi IP address. 
            This way communication between the Pi and Jetson will use the ethernet cable but outside computers can still be on the 
            same ROS network. This is obviously problematic though if you want to run multiple Turtlebots like this at the same 
            time, in which case you may need to find a better solution.
