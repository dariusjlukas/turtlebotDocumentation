            The Jetson Nano can be used with the Mynt Eye in the same way you would use the Mynt Eye with a computer, 
            except that based on <span class="tooltip">benchmarks
            <span class="tooltiptext">Comparison of Phoronix Test Suite results from my laptop (i7-3630QM, Nvidia GT 650M, 15.6 GB DDR3L, 250 GB SSD) and the Jetson Nano. Results ranged from 1.6x faster to 21.5x faster, depending on the task.</span></span> 
            the Jetson Nano is ~5x slower than an old laptop computer, depending on the task. The Jetson Nano is also
            limited by its 4GB of RAM, but should be sufficient for use with the turtlebots. If you get to the point 
            where the Jetson Nano has inadequate processing power, Nvida sells more powerful systems in the <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/buy-jetson">Jetson 
            family</a> of products, and there are a variety of options from other manufacturers.

            getting the Jetson Nano working with the Mynt Eye.
