            <h3>Overview:</h3>
            The turtlebot workstation should be set up with the SDK for the cameras, but the installation 
            instructions can be found
            <a target="_blank" href="https://mynt-eye-d-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/build_linux.html">here</a>.

            I had installation issues on Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu 19.04 but no problems with Ubuntu 16.04 with ROS 
            Kinetic installed. I do recommend installing ROS before going through the Mynt Eye setup. Also, I tried
             but was unsuccessful setting up a VM of ubuntu 16.04 with the Mynt Eye SDK and ended up doing a fresh install of 
             16.04 on my laptop. The only visual odometry examples I was able to get running were the VINS-mono and 
             VINS-fusion packages. Instructions to do so can be found
             <a target="_blank" href="https://mynt-eye-d-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/slam/vins_fusion.html">here</a>.
            And for the record, you most certainly do not need 16GB of ram to run VINS-fusion, more like 8.
