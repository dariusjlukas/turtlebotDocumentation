                So, the turtlebot is <a href="turtleSetup.html">set up</a>, you have a <a href="turtleWorkstationSetup.html">computer set up</a> to work with it, you are on the same network as the turtlebot, the turtlebot
                is powered on, your computer is turned on, the wifi is working, you are sure the turtlebot is on
                the same wifi as you are, the turtlebot it not currently beeping at you, and it is not sitting
                somewhere high off the ground. The basic steps to make the turtlebot drive are as follows:

            <ol>
                <li>Launch the roscore application on the master computer (likely your computer). To do this,
                    run:
                    <div class="cmd">$ roscore</div>
                    in a terminal. It should complete looking something like: 
                    <div class="cmd">

                <li>
                    SSH into the turtlebot (or hookup a monitor, mouse, and keyboard) and run the command:
                    <div class="cmd">$ roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_robot.launch</div>
                    This will use roslaunch to launch the turtlebot3_bringup package using the turtlebot3_robot.launch 
                    launchfile. 
                    To ssh into a turtlebot you can use the command:
                    <div class="cmd">$ ssh pi@turtlebot{turtlebot number}</div>
                    replacing {turtlebot number} with the number of the turtlebot you are ssh'ing into. If prompted for
                    a password type: "turtlebot". If the host cannot be resolved, replace "turtlebot#" with the ip address of
                    the turtlebot, which is written on each turtlebot and looks like: 192.168.10.{something}.
                    <br><br>
                    If the roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_robot.launch command completes successfully, you should
                    see output like:

                    You have completed all of the basic setup steps to launch the turtlebot's ROS nodes, so if you  
                    type:
                    <div class="cmd">$ rostopic list</div>
                    you should see a variety of topics. Rviz can be used to easily visualize the data:
                    <div class="cmd">$ rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find turtlebot3_description`/rviz/model.rviz</div>
                    To try driving the robot around, you can use:
                    <div class="cmd">$ roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch</div>
                    You can also cause the turtlebot to move by directly publishing to the /cmd_vel topic.
                    To publish to a ROS topic from the command line, use:
                    <div class="cmd">$ rostopic pub {topic name} {topic message type} {topic message}</div>
                    For example, to make the turtlebot go forwards you could use:
                    <div class="cmd">$ rostopic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist "linear:<br>
                        &nbsp &nbsp  x: 1.0<br>
                        &nbsp &nbsp    y: 0.0<br>
                        &nbsp &nbsp   z: 0.0<br>
                         angular:<br>
                        &nbsp &nbsp   x: 0.0<br>
                        &nbsp &nbsp   y: 0.0<br>
                        &nbsp &nbsp   z: 0.0" 
                          </div>
                    To stop it, run:
                    <div class="cmd">$ rostopic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist "linear:<br>
                        &nbsp &nbsp   x: 0.0<br>
                        &nbsp &nbsp   y: 0.0<br>
                        &nbsp &nbsp   z: 0.0<br>
                          angular:<br>
                        &nbsp &nbsp   x: 0.0<br>
                        &nbsp &nbsp   y: 0.0<br>
                        &nbsp &nbsp   z: 0.0" 
                          </div>
                    To list the topics you can publish to, run:
                    <div class="cmd">$ rostopic list</div>
                    If you want to figure out the message format for any given topic, simply his [tab] after
                    typing "rostopic pub {topic name}". For example, a quick way to publish to the motor topic
                    would be:
                    <div class="cmd">$ rostopic pub /cmd_vel [tab] [tab]</div>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To try out more examples with the turtlebot3, consult the 
                    <a target="_blank" href="http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/basic_operation/#basic-operation">e-Manual</a>
                    , which is where I got these commands from.
