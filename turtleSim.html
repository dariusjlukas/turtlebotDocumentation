            <h3>Simulation</h3>
            One of the great things about ROS is the ease of simulating robots and how little code must be changed between 
            simulation and reality. The concept is that since ROS robots work by publishing and subscribing to topics, we 
            can create a simulated turtlebot which subscribes and publishes to those same topics. In this way, there is often 
            no need to make any changes to your program between a simulated Turtlebot and a real Turtlebot. In fact, if you 
            have a Turtlebot on the same ROS network as a simulation, the Turtlebot will mirror the movements of the simulated 
            Turtlebot. There are two ways of running simulations in ROS, either using RViz, which can do simple simulations, 
            or <span class="tooltip">Gazebo<span class="tooltiptext">
                Fun fact: also the official simulator for the DARPA robotics challenge
            </span></span>, 
            the primary simulation program for ROS capable of simulating complex environments. 
        </div>
        <div class="dark box">
            <h3>Using RViz</h3>
            You can do some simulation of a Turtlebot using just the RViz visualization program and a fake Turtlebot 3 node, 
            which publishes and subscribes to the same topics as a real Turtlebot. To do this, the setup is similar to a 
            real Turtlebot. First, launch roscore:
            <div class="cmd">
                $ roscore
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">Common Problems:</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p>If you get a complaint about "ROS_MASTER_URI [...] host is not set to this machine" or something similar, it means 
            that the environment variable which keeps track of the ROS master is pointing to a different IP address. To change 
            this, first kill roscore by typing CTRL+C in the terminal, then edit your .bashrc file by typing:</p>
            <div class="cmd">
                $ nano ~/.bashrc
            </div>
            Find the line that says "export ROS_MASTER_URI=..." and change the IP address (the string of numbers after the 
            "http://" and before the ":11311") so that it matches your IP address, which can be found either by opening a 
            new terminal and typing: 
            <div class="cmd">
                $ ifconfig
            </div>
            or by reading off the value of your ROS_HOSTNAME environment variable, likely right below your 
            ROS_MASTER_URI line in your .bashrc file. After you have updated the ROS_MASTER_URI, exit and save your .bashrc 
            file, then source it and restart roscore:
            <div class="cmd">
                $ source ~/.bashrc<br>
                $ roscore
            </div> 
            <p>If this still does not work, I recommend trying the <a href="turtleTroubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting</a> page.</p>
            </div>

            Next, you will need to start the fake Turtlebot node:
            <div class="cmd">
                $ roslaunch turtlebot3_fake turtlebot3_fake.launch
            </div>
            <p>If everything worked, RViz should open and you should see a fake Turtlebot sitting in the middle of the seen.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center">
            <img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/rviz.png" alt="Picture of RViz">
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">Common Problems:</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>The most likely errors here are either that you did not set the TURTLEBOT3_MODEL environment variable or 
                    that you did not install the simulation packages. To set the environment variable, run:
                    <div class="cmd">
                        $ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
                    </div>
                    And try running the turtlebot3_fake node again. If this still does not work, you can try installing the 
                    simulation packages:
                    <div class="cmd">
                        $ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/<br>
                        $ git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations.git<br>
                        $ cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make<br>
                        $ source .bashrc
                    </div>
                    Try running the turtlebot3_fake node again, and if it still does not work try checking out the 
                    <a href="turtleTroubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting</a> page for common problems.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                Now you can launch standard ROS nodes such as keyboard telemetry:
                <div class="cmd">
                    $ roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch
                </div>
                This is a rather basic simulation, as it lacks an interesting environment and things like laser scan 
                data, but can be useful for testing out simple programs. For a more capable simulation program, use Gazebo.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="dark box">
            <h3>Using Gazebo</h3>
            Gazebo provides a full physics and sensor simulation environment for ROS. To launch a simple Turtlebot3 simulation 
            run:
            <div class="cmd">
                $ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch
            </div>
            <p>You should see a Turtlebot3 sitting in an obstacle course shaped like the Turtlebot logo.</p>
            <div style="text-align: center">
                <img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/gazebo1.png" alt="Picture of a Turtlebot3 in Gazebo">
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">Common Problems:</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>The Gazebo environment should be mostly self-sufficient, but there can be issues if you did not se the 
                TURTLEBOT3_MODEL environment variable and you should have ROS_MASTER_URI pointing at your local computer.
                To set the TURTLEBOT3_MODEL environment variable run:
                <div class="cmd">
                    $ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
                </div>
                To change the ROS_MASTER_URI, follow these instructions:
                First, kill Gazebo by <span class="tooltip">hitting CTRL+C <span class="tooltiptext">Hitting is more dramatic than typing</span></span> 
                in the terminal, then edit your .bashrc file by typing:</p>
                <div class="cmd">
                    $ nano ~/.bashrc
                </div>
                Find the line that says "export ROS_MASTER_URI=..." and change the IP address (the string of numbers after the 
                "http://" and before the ":11311") so that it matches your IP address, which can be found either by opening a 
                new terminal and typing: 
                <div class="cmd">
                    $ ifconfig
                </div>
                or by reading off the value of your ROS_HOSTNAME environment variable, likely right below your 
                ROS_MASTER_URI line in your .bashrc file. After you have updated the ROS_MASTER_URI, exit and save your .bashrc 
                file, then source it and re-start Gazebo:
                <div class="cmd">
                    $ source ~/.bashrc<br>
                    $ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch
                </div>
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Now, you can just about follow the instructions on the <a href="turtleQuickStart.html">Quickstart</a> 
                page, except roscore and the packages on the Turtlebot have already been launched for you. For example, 
                to get the standard RViz output run:
                <div class="cmd">
                    $ roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_remote.launch<br>
                    $ rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find turtlebot3_description`/rviz/model.rviz
                </div>
                To drive the simulated Turtlebot around, type:
                <div class="cmd">
                    $ roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch
                </div>
                To have the Turtlebot drive randomly and avoid obstacles, try: (be sure to stop the Teleop node first)
                <div class="cmd">
                    $ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_simulation.launch
                </div>
                As you can see, these are exactly the same as what you would do with a real Turtlebot (the last command is new, 
                but runs on the Turtlebot as well). In fact, most things you do with the Turtlebot can be done in the 
                simulation as well, such as SLAM, navigation, etc. To demonstrate how powerful this is, say you had a Turtlebot 
                running with a Jetson instead of a Pi and you wanted to simulate that, or you wanted to see how quickly something 
                ran on a Pi as compared to a desktop. Thanks to the pub/sub nature of ROS, you can simply have those devices 
                point to your workstation as the ROS master node and then run whatever you want to on those devices, since 
                as far as ROS is concerned there is no difference between the simulated Turtlebot and the real Turtlebot, and it 
                does not matter where the device running a ROS node is physically, or virtually, located so long as it is on the 
                same network. Simulating different sensors is a bit more difficult but there are ways to add custom sensors to a 
                Gazebo model. One shortcut is to use a robot model that already has the sensor you want to simulate. For example, 
                if you wanted to simulate a depth camera you could use the Turtlebot3 waffle instead of the burger variant 
                because the waffle comes with a depth camera.
