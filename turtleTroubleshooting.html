            <button class="accordion">You go to launch turtlebot3_bringup on the turtlebot and
                it complains that it does not exist.</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>
                    It is likely that the correct setup.sh script has not been sourced. If the package is on of the
                    standard ones, run “source ~/burger_ws/devel/setup.sh”. To avoid doing this on every reboot,
                    add that line to the <a target="_blank" href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/129143/what-is-the-purpose-of-bashrc-and-how-does-it-work">.bashrc</a> file (don’t forget to source .bashrc after changing it). If the
                    turtlebot complains that the setup.sh file does not exist, try to cd to ~/burger_ws and run
                    catkin_make, then try again. If it still is not there I would recommend copying the burger_ws
                    folder from another turtlebot.

                    Replace/recharge the battery, but don’t recharge the battery while it is plugged into the
                    turtlebot. Being in this state will also prevent the turtlebot from driving, which is a
                    feature I believe to be implemented in the OpenCR firmware. This means you will need to power
                    off the turtlebot completely and turn it back on again before continuing.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Make sure you are on the wifi network named “Linksys08906” or
                            "Linksys08906_5GHz".
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Try “ssh pi@turtebot1”, replacing the “1” with the number of the turtlebot.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If host cannot be resolved: then try typing out the ip address of the turtlebot,
                            which is written on each turtlebot, ie. “ssh pi@192.168.1.142”. If this still says
                            host cannot be resolved, then try plugging a monitor and keyboard into the turtlebot
                            and make sure it is on the “Linksys…” network. Alternatively, make sure you are still on
                            the Linksys… network.

                                Password is “turtlebot”. To avoid typing the password every time, 
                                you can generate an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys--2">RSA key pair</a> 
                                and use that.

                        Check the turtlebot’s <a target="_blank" href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/129143/what-is-the-purpose-of-bashrc-and-how-does-it-work">.bashrc</a> file (nano ~/.bashrc). The end of the file should look something
                        like:
                        <div class="cmd">
                            source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash <br>

                            source ~/burger_ws/devel/setup.bash <br>


                            export ROS_MASTER_URI= <span style="color:green">{http://192.168.1.115:11311}</span> <br>

                        </div>
                        But replace the ROS_MASTER_URI with the IP address of the computer running roscore and 
                        replace the ROS_HOSTNAME with the turtlebot’s own ip address (can be checked with ifconfig). <br>
