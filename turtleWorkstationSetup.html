            One of the great things about ROS is that since most tasks are done over the network through publisher/subscriber 
            communication (see chapter 4 of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pishrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ROS-robot-programming-book-by-turtlebo3-developers-EN.pdf">this</a> book to learn more) 
            many tasks can run on any system in the network. For instance, in the turtlebot examples almost all of the ROS nodes are running on an outside 
            computer instead of directly on the turtlebot. This provides convenience, ease of use, ease of debugging, and the ability to leverage immense 
            amounts of processing power on your ROS-enabled robot. It should be noted that, unlike in the image above, the ROS network is not a cloud, and 
            there is a <span class="tooltip">single master node<span class="tooltiptext">For ROS 1, this is not the case in ROS 2; you are likely using ROS 1</span></span> in your network and that device manages the ROS network, no magic or wizards involved. 
            For this to work, you need to have a desktop computer (or any computer really) set up 
            to work with the turtlebot. The basic criteria to do this are as follows:
            <ol>
                <li><span class="tooltip">Set up a computer with Ubuntu Linux 16.04<span class="tooltiptext" style="width: 24em; margin-left: -12em">You can technically run other Linux 
                    distributions, and in fact you will likely need to if you are not using ROS Kinetic. There is also a way to use Windows with ROS. I highly 
                    recommend a local installation of Ubuntu 16.04 if you are using ROS Kinetic as it will be the easiest to set up and likely the 
                    easiest to use.
                </span></span></li>
                <li>Install ROS <span class="tooltip">Kinetic<span class="tooltiptext">At the time of writing this, 
                    Kinetic gives the most compatibility with the turtlebots</span></span> on that computer</li>
                <li>Install Turtlebot-specific packages on that computer</li>
                <li>Make sure you are on the same network as the turtlebot</li>
                <li>Run the turtlebot from your computer</li>
            </ol>
