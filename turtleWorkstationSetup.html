            One of the great things about ROS is that since most tasks are done over the network through publisher/subscriber 
            communication (see chapter 4 of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pishrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ROS-robot-programming-book-by-turtlebo3-developers-EN.pdf">this</a> book to learn more) 
            many tasks can run on any system in the network. For instance, in the turtlebot examples almost all of the ROS nodes are running on an outside 
            computer instead of directly on the turtlebot. This provides convenience, ease of use, ease of debugging, and the ability to leverage immense 
            amounts of processing power on your ROS-enabled robot. It should be noted that, unlike in the image above, the ROS network is not a cloud, and 
            there is a <span class="tooltip">single master node<span class="tooltiptext">For ROS 1. This is not the case in ROS 2. You are likely using ROS 1.</span></span> in your network and that device manages the ROS network, no magic or wizards involved. 
            For this to work, you need to have a desktop computer (or any computer really) set up 
            to work with the turtlebot. The basic criteria to do this are as follows:
            <ol>
                <li><span class="tooltip">Set up a computer with Ubuntu Linux 16.04<span class="tooltiptext" style="width: 24em; margin-left: -12em">You can run other Linux 
                    distributions, and in fact you will likely need to if you are not using ROS Kinetic. There is also a way to use Windows with ROS. I highly 
                    recommend a local installation of Ubuntu 16.04 if you are using ROS Kinetic as it will be the easiest to set up and likely the 
                    easiest to use. See the <a href="resource.html">resources</a> page for links to linux guides.
                </span></span></li>
                <li>Install ROS <span class="tooltip">Kinetic<span class="tooltiptext">At the time of writing this, 
                    Kinetic gives the most compatibility with the turtlebots</span></span> on that computer</li>
                <li>Install Turtlebot-specific packages on that computer</li>
                <li>Make sure you are on the same network as the turtlebot</li>
                <li>Run the turtlebot from your computer</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="dark box">
            A comprehensive guide for setting up a workstation to work with the Turtlebot can be found 
            <a target="_blank" href="http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/pc_setup/">here</a>. What follows is 
            a summary of that.
            <br><br>
            You can use the following script to install ROS Kinetic with relative ease:
            <div class="cmd">
                $ sudo apt update<br>
                $ sudo apt upgrade<br>
                $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/robotis_tools/master/install_ros_kinetic.sh && chmod 755 ./install_ros_kinetic.sh && bash ./install_ros_kinetic.sh<br>
            </div>
            If that does not work, you can follow the manual installation steps found <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation">here</a>. <br>
            <br>
            Next, install the turtlebot specific ROS packages:
            <div class="cmd">
                $ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-joy ros-kinetic-teleop-twist-joy ros-kinetic-teleop-twist-keyboard ros-kinetic-laser-proc ros-kinetic-rgbd-launch ros-kinetic-depthimage-to-laserscan ros-kinetic-rosserial-arduino ros-kinetic-rosserial-python ros-kinetic-rosserial-server ros-kinetic-rosserial-client ros-kinetic-rosserial-msgs ros-kinetic-amcl ros-kinetic-map-server ros-kinetic-move-base ros-kinetic-urdf ros-kinetic-xacro ros-kinetic-compressed-image-transport ros-kinetic-rqt-image-view ros-kinetic-gmapping ros-kinetic-navigation ros-kinetic-interactive-markers<br>
                $ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/<br>
                $ git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_msgs.git<br>
                $ git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3.git<br>
                $ git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations.git<br>
                $ cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make<br>
            </div>
            Now, the network needs to be set up. The basic topology of a ROS network consists of a single master 
            node and some number of other nodes on the network. The term node here refers to individual ROS 
            programs, and many nodes can run on a single physical machine or these nodes can be spread out across 
            many machines. The important point is that ROS needs a network and a master node to operate, even if 
            there is only one physical machine on that network. See chapter 4 of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pishrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ROS-robot-programming-book-by-turtlebo3-developers-EN.pdf">this</a> 
            book to learn more. In order for this to work, each physical machine 
            needs to know the <span class="tooltip">IP-address<span style="width: 12em; margin-left: -6em" class="tooltiptext">Internet Protocol Address; A series of numbers like: 192.168.10.123 that identifies a computer on a network.</span></span>
            of itself and the IP-address of the ROS master node. It does not need to know the IP-addresses of any 
            other computers on the ROS network, if there are any, because the master node will facilitate 
            communication with those devices. To do this, ROS uses <span class="tooltip">environment variables<span class="tooltiptext">
                Variables shared accross the system; learn more <a target="_blank" href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-read-and-set-environmental-and-shell-variables-on-a-linux-vps">here</a>
            </span></span>
            called ROS_MASTER_URI and ROS_HOSTNAME. In linux, the syntax to set an environment variable is 
            <div class="cmd">
                <span style="color: green">Do NOT type this into your terminal!</span><br>
                $ export variable_name=value
            </div>
            but, if you did this manually, you would need to type it every time you opened a new terminal. To avoid 
            doing that, we will add the export commands to the end of the <span class="tooltip">.bashrc<span class="tooltiptext">
                A shell script which is run each time you open a new terminal; learn more <a target="_blank" href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/129143/what-is-the-purpose-of-bashrc-and-how-does-it-work">here</a>
            </span></span>
            file so that they are run automatically. When setting up your workstation, both the master and 
            hostname point to the same address, assuming you are running the ROS master from your workstation. 
            To check your machine's IP address, run:
            <div class="cmd">
                $ ifconfig
            </div>
            There should be a line that starts with "inet addr:" followed by a number 192.168.10.XXX . Note that 
            your could have multiple IP-addresses. If your IP-address does not start with "192.168.10" you are 
            probably not on the lab's WiFi, and you will need to get on it before continuing. It should be called 
            Linksys08906{something} and the password is written on a sticky note on the router. <br>
            Once you have your IP-address, remember it (here is a convenient place to write it down):
            <form>
                <input type="text" value="192.168.10.">
            </form>
            Now edit your .bashrc file by typing:
            <div class="cmd">
                $ nano ~/.bashrc
            </div>
            If there are already export lines for master and hostname, modify them, if not add them, so that there 
            are three lines in your .bashr file that look like:
            <div class="cmd">
                export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://{YOUR_IP_HERE}:11311<br>
                export ROS_HOSTNAME={YOUR_IP_HERE}<br>
                <span class="tooltip">export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger<span class="tooltiptext" style="width: 12em; margin-left: -6em">
                    This line tells ROS that you are using the Turtlebot3 Burger model, and is necessary for running simulations
                </span></span>
            </div>
            After editing your .bashrc file, you need to source it for changes to take effect (or you could close 
            and re-open all your terminals, but sourcing is faster). You can do this by typing:
            <div class="cmd">
                $ source ~/.bashrc
            </div>
            <br>
            At this point, your computer should be set up to work with the turtlebots. Assuming you have at least 
            one turtlebot set up as well, you can head to the <a href="turtleQuickStart.html">Quickstart</a>
            page to test your setup. If you have problems, please consult the <a href="turtleTroubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting</a> 
            page or use the questions box on the <a href="resource.html">Resources</a> page. Getting the workstation 
            setup right was one of the most frustrating parts when I first tried it, so hopefully this helped.
